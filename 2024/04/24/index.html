  <h3 id="creating">Creating</h3>
<p>Torn Leaf Submission!</p>
<ul>
<li>Made a <a href="https://mas.to/@ncb/112261787665163204">submission</a> to Torn Leaf! More
details at <a href="https://tornleaf.gallery/">tornleaf.gallery</a> as to what this is.
It was fun, haven't had an excuse to mess around with Unreal for a while.
Ended up tinkering a ton.</li>
<li>Looking forward to more in the future, whether through prompts like this or
other sources of inspiration to create something cool</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consuming">Consuming</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune</a> by Frank Herbert.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was very good. Looking forward to watching the movies. Having now read the
books I can see why the first movie wasn't talked about much.</li>
<li>I think the world building going on in the first part will be fascinating to
see. The story that follows as result of that world was fantastically executed
in the novel, and there are some scenes that I could see lending themselves
well to the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did not finish
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightfall_and_Other_Stories">Nightfall and Other Stories</a>
by Isaac Asimov.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished roughly half of the stories. Nightfall was well worth the read before
the eclipse. Will check out from library again in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYT2se94eU0&amp;list=WL">The Computer Revolution Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Spurred on by <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/">the Future of coding home page</a>, I
watched this talk. Dozens of the core ideas and issues of software and
architecture design are outlined here. It felt refreshing, and a bit
concerning to hear the same ideas still be relevant. The different scales of
operation have only made the solutions to the same problems different as well,
it hasn't solved them. I suppose that's job security if nothing else.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="considering">Considering</h3>
<p>Was taking a look at some of <a href="https://macwright.com/">Tom MacWright</a>'s posts,
specifically <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/02/06/how-to-blog">this one</a>, and the
reasoning about posting on a schedule clarified some things for me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/now">Now</a> was already inspired by the
<a href="https://macwright.com/2024/04/02/recently">recently</a> posts. I understood that
it would help with writing more, and had seen the benefits of that at my first
internship, but I missed the second point entirely. Having this as a single
separate page leaves the website looking a bit empty, despite the <em>relatively</em>
consistent updates. As such these are being reworked into &quot;real&quot; posts, to
make it clear that the website isn't abandoned.</li>
<li>It does look goofy with the names all listed as &quot;now&quot;, so I'll probalby rename
them in the future. Really this should be further encouragement to write more
of those posts.</li>
</ul>
