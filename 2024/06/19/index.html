<p>So, I have a problem with bags.</p>
<p>I want to replace what is currently a school bag that has been used for ~10
years. In that time it's held up fairly well (the one it replaced lasted 7 years
if I remember correctly) and has served it's purpose of carrying school, note
<em>and</em> text books, a range of laptops, as well as entirely too many groceries.
It's time has come, but there to many options that seem <code>good enough</code> and
deciding between them has become impossible. In an effort to solve this problem
I'll be outlining my issues with the current bag below, to restart the search
with a more direct approach.</p>
<p>Having said that, this is in no way a <em>good</em> review of this bag due to the
limited range of my bag experience. My points of comparison are a
<small>small</small> collection of cheap draw-string bags, a
<a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83531?page=super-deluxe-book-pack&amp;bc=32-305-511658&amp;feat=511658-GN3&amp;csp=s&amp;attrValue_0=1&amp;pos=1&amp;imgt=41">school backpack</a>
as a daily bag, and finally a
<a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/123975?page=excursion-travel-pack-45l&amp;bc=50-516673-514260&amp;feat=514260-GN3&amp;csp=f&amp;attrValue_0=46399&amp;pos=1">travel bag</a>.

is not necessarily being replaced, but is a point of comparison and has some
problems of its own. It will probably be explored in a future post, but briefly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has more padding than is necessary, since it's mostly carrying clothes.
Fitting a 16&quot; MacBook is not impossible, but is a bit tight, and fitting an
additional 14&quot; laptop as well is not enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred or so bags have also been considered through online research, as well
as some brief hands on experiences with the
<a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/all-bags/products/everyday-backpack">Peak Design Everyday Bag</a>
and the <a href="https://www.lttstore.com/products/backpack">LTT Backpack</a> but we're
getting ahead of ourselves. We'll get into problems with other bags in a future
post, but this should give an idea of the price point of bag I'm considering as
well as comparing this significantly cheaper bag against.</p>
<p>This may result in unreasonable expectations for what a <em>perfect</em> bag would
provide, and there's a good chance no existing bag solves every problem I
outline. However, it will create a
<i title="Concrete which probably hasn't dried">relatively concrete</i>
collection of criteria for comparison. In the scenario where no bag meets this
criteria, I will
<a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/">just</a> build my
own.</p>

<p>It is a nice enough backpack, but it has the following problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="too-wide">Too Wide</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no good way to pack it without too much of the weight being too far
from my back. I'd rather keep the weight near my body, and ideally it would
expand upwards, rather than outwards. The majority of the organizational bits
are in the wrong spot, by being in the outermost pocket any weight in those
pockets ends up being exaggerated, and the pockets end up rarely if ever used.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="too-big">Too Big</h4>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Most days two of the sections are empty, those being the two outermost pockets.
The main pocket is a bit too big as well, especially for every day use. It is
the right size for travel, and has room to pack another bag if necessary. This
makes it expandable without being expandable.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="too-warm">Too Warm</h4>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no ventilation on the back of the bag. Loosening in an attempt to help
makes the bag uncomfortable when properly filled. Due to the only pressure
points being the two shoulders and the lower back, unless the bag is tightened
all the way. In doing that it brings the entirety of this pack directly up
against my back, completely cutting off all airflow. Hanging off of one shoulder
helps a bit but becomes uncomfortable quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="too-misc">Too Misc.</h4>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't compact down as much as I'd like. Would rather it be smaller and
expand upwards if expanding.</li>
<li>Has bad waist strap (and broken, from years of dangling unused)</li>
<li>Does not inspire confidence in a rainstorm</li>
<li>Organization is in all the wrong spots</li>
<li>Water bottle holders are kinda trash</li>
<li>Shoulder strap pocket is kinda useless since it can't close</li>
<li>Doesn't get complements from strangers</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Can fit a full weekends worth of travel clothes, with plenty of room to spare</li>
<li>Can kinda fit into the travel bag if needed</li>
<li>The material cleans <em>very</em> well</li>
<li>Has a key holder, essential while traveling</li>
<li>Has a laptop slot that can work for 14 or 16 inch laptops, <em>and</em> can fit both
when necessary</li>
<li>Has the roughly right amount of organization</li>
<li>The material is durable and cleans very well. It's survived several
<a href="https://lostterminal.com/">unnecessarily salty</a> winter roads.</li>
<li>Doesn't get complements from strangers</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed only fair to outline the alright parts of this bag, since it has
worked well for so long. It will make a nice large backup bag, and may see
continued use for larger grocery runs, but it's time of daily use is coming to
an end. There may be some followup posts cataloging my journey in search of an
alternative bag, but again only time will tell.</p>
<p>If you have a bag recommendation, that solves these problems I would love a
link. I've been categorizing every bag I can come across, and
